### New and noteworthy

#### Performance improvements for XPath 2.0 rules

XPath rules written with XPath 2.0 now support conversion to a rulechain rule, which
improves their performance. The rulechain is a mechanism that allows several rules
to be executed in a single tree traversal. Conversion to the rulechain is possible if
your XPath expression looks like `//someNode/... | //someOtherNode/...  | ...`, that
is, a union of one or more path expressions that start with `//`. Instead of traversing
the whole tree once per path expression (and per rule), a single traversal executes all
rules in your ruleset as needed.

This conversion is performed automatically and cannot be disabled. *The conversion should
not change the result of your rules*, if it does, please report a bug at https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues

Note that XPath 1.0 support, the default XPath version, is deprecated since PMD 6.22.0.
**We highly recommend that you upgrade your rules to XPath 2.0**. Please refer to the [migration guide](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_extending_writing_xpath_rules.html#migrating-from-10-to-20).

### API Changes

#### Deprecated APIs

##### Internal API

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

##### In ASTs

As part of the changes we'd like to do to AST classes for 7.0.0, we would like to
hide some methods and constructors that rule writers should not have access to.
The following usages are now deprecated in the **Visualforce** and **PLSQL** ASTs:

*   Manual instantiation of nodes. **Constructors of node classes are deprecated** and
    marked {% jdoc core::annotation.InternalApi %}. Nodes should only be obtained from the parser,
    which for rules, means that they never need to instantiate node themselves.
    Those constructors will be made package private with 7.0.0.
*   **Subclassing of abstract node classes, or usage of their type**. The base classes are internal API
    and will be hidden in version 7.0.0. You should not couple your code to them.
    *   In the meantime you should use interfaces like {% jdoc visualforce::lang.vf.ast.VfNode %} or
        {% jdoc core::lang.ast.Node %}, or the other published interfaces in this package,
        to refer to nodes generically.
    *   Concrete node classes will **be made final** with 7.0.0.
*   Setters found in any node class or interface. **Rules should consider the AST immutable**.
    We will make those setters package private with 7.0.0.
*   The implementation classes of {% jdoc core::lang.Parser %} (eg {% jdoc visualforce::lang.vf.VfParser %}) are deprecated and should not be used directly.
    Use {% jdoc !!core::lang.LanguageVersionHandler#getParser(ParserOptions) %} instead.
*   The implementation classes of {% jdoc core::lang.TokenManager %} (eg {% jdoc visualforce::lang.vf.VfTokenManager %}) are deprecated and should not be used outside of our implementation.
    **This also affects CPD-only modules**.

These deprecations are added to the following language modules in this release.
Please look at the package documentation to find out the full list of deprecations.
* Visualforce: **{% jdoc_package visualforce::lang.vf.ast %}**
* PL/SQL: **{% jdoc_package plsql::lang.plsql.ast %}**

These deprecations have already been rolled out in a previous version for the
following languages:
* Java: {% jdoc_package java::lang.java.ast %}
* Java Server Pages: {% jdoc_package jsp::lang.jsp.ast %}
* Velocity Template Language: {% jdoc_package vm::lang.vm.ast %}

Outside of these packages, these changes also concern the following TokenManager
implementations, and their corresponding Parser if it exists (in the same package):

*   {% jdoc vm::lang.vm.VmTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc java::lang.java.JavaTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc python::lang.python.PythonTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc visualforce::lang.vf.VfTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc plsql::lang.plsql.PLSQLTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc jsp::lang.jsp.JspTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc modelica::lang.modelica.ModelicaTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc cpp::lang.cpp.CppTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc javascript::lang.ecmascript5.Ecmascript5TokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc matlab::lang.matlab.MatlabTokenManager %}
*   {% jdoc objectivec::lang.objectivec.ObjectiveCTokenManager %}
