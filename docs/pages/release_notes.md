### New and noteworthy

#### Modified rules

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/errorprone/CompareObjectsWithEquals" %} has now a new property
    `typesThatCompareByReference`. With that property, you can configure types, that should be whitelisted
    for comparison by reference. By default, `java.lang.Enum` and `java.lang.Class` are allowed, but
    you could add custom types here.
    Additionally comparisons against constants are allowed now. This makes the rule less noisy when two constants
    are compared. Constants are identified by looking for an all-caps identifier.
